# Tanamore 🌱

**Capstone Project for Urban Gardening Support Application**

## Project Overview

Tanamore is a mobile application designed to assist urban gardeners, especially beginners, in managing and maintaining plant health. This application leverages machine learning to provide plant disease detection and personalized care recommendations, enabling users to overcome common challenges in gardening and increase their confidence in plant care.

## Background

Urban agriculture is gaining traction as a sustainable approach to address food security and enhance green spaces in cities. Many new urban gardeners face difficulties in plant care, including identifying plant diseases and determining appropriate treatment routines. Tanamore aims to support these gardeners by providing tools to help them recognize and treat plant diseases while receiving care tips for maintaining plant health.

## Key Features

1. **User Registration** - Allows users to create an account, enabling personalized recommendations.
2. **Plant Disease Detection** - Identifies plant diseases via photo upload, providing insights into the plant’s health.
3. **Treatment Recommendation** - Provides tailored advice based on plant type and disease, including watering, nutrient, and light needs.
4. **Plant Watering Reminder** - Sends notifications to remind users when to water their plants, ensuring timely care.
5. **Encyclopedia of Plants and Diseases** - A comprehensive guide containing descriptions, habitats, common diseases, and preventive measures.

## Project Goals

- Simplify plant identification and care for urban gardeners.
- Foster interest in sustainable gardening practices.
- Encourage the gardening hobby by making plant care more accessible.
